In general terms, a _pseudo-class_ is sort of a phantom state or a specific characteristic of an element that we can target with CSS.  _Pseudo-classes_ allow you to apply styles to an element based on its state, its interaction with the user, or its position in the document. Single colon is the syntax for pseudo classes.
